## About Census Data Set
### Overview
The Census Income dataset is a collection of individual records representing various attributes of individuals, including demographic, educational, and employment-related information. This dataset is often used for classification tasks, specifically for predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 (">50K") or not ("<=50K").

### Dataset Information

#### Data Columns

1. **ID**: An identifier for each individual.
2. **age**: The age of the individual.
3. **workclass**: The type of workclass the individual belongs to (e.g., State-gov, Self-emp-not-inc, Private, etc.).
4. **fnlwgt**: The final weight, which represents the number of people the census believes the entry represents.
5. **education**: The highest level of education completed by the individual.
6. **education_num**: A numerical representation of education, often equivalent to the years of education.
7. **marital_status**: The marital status of the individual.
8. **occupation**: The type of occupation the individual is engaged in.
9. **relationship**: The individual's relationship status (e.g., Husband, Not-in-family, Own-child, etc.).
10. **race**: The race of the individual.
11. **sex**: The gender of the individual.
12. **capital_gain**: The amount of capital gains the individual has.
13. **capital_loss**: The amount of capital losses the individual has.
14. **hr_per_wk**: The number of hours worked per week.
15. **native_country**: The native country of the individual.
16. **class**: The target variable, indicating whether the individual's income exceeds $50,000 (">50K") or not ("<=50K").

#### Data Sample
Here's a sample of the first few records in the dataset:


### Purpose
This dataset is often used for tasks related to income prediction, demographic analysis, and employment trends. It can be used to build predictive models to classify individuals into income categories and gain insights into the factors affecting an individual's income.

### Dataset Source
The dataset is commonly used in machine learning and data science and can be found on various platforms and data repositories.
